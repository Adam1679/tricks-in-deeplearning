Using different tricks to improve performance of resetnet50 by Keras

Paper：https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187

Resnet50 model and other CNN models implemented by keras can be found from: https://github.com/BIGBALLON/cifar-10-cnn

Train baseline Resnet50 model （done)  accuracy: 91.5%(+/-0.2%)

Adding cosine decay（on progress）
